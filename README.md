# Ripe Apples
Do you ever feel overwhelmed by the bounty of restaurant review and rating websites? So do we, so we built Ripe Apples. Ripe Apples is a web application that aggregates reviews from major restaurant review sites (including Yelp, Foursquare, Zomato and Google) and merges them into a single score. 

Ripe Apples is a single-page-application built using React, Redux, Node, Express and Sequelize. While the restaurant scores are the application's killer feature, the app also allows users to filter restaurants based on their price and cuisine type. Additionally, users can change the scoring weights for restaurants based on which rating-sources they prefer. The most interesting problem we tackled was implementing multiple (and limited) APIs to seed our database and standardizing the data.
